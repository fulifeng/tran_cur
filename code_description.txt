# Forgive me, there are too many duplicate and one time code as two projects: collage entrance line prediction and transductive univeristy ranking are jointly developed. Here are some code wrote for collage entrance line prediction:

pre_ent_line/
    # code under this folder is wrote for collage entrance line prediction

    experiment.py
        # Code for pair-wise experiment
        # How to run (jump to the end of this file):
            # For average collage entrance line prediction, comment the final line 'exp_province(            # )' and then execute 'python experiment.py'
            # For province and category-wised prediction, uncomment the final line, comment the 
            # remaining, and execute the same command

    pow_experiment.py
        # Code for point-wise experiment
        # How to run:
            #Similar to experiment.py

    ground_truth.py
        # Generate pair-wise ground truth for each province and each category (
        literal/science)
        # How to run:
            # Simply execute 'python ground_truth.py'

    gaokao_feature.py
        # Extract universities' collage entrance lines, only a function 'extract_uni_line_fir' is        #  used.
        # How to run:
            # Simply execute 'python ground_truth.py'

evaluator.py:
    # evaluate a generated ranking list

feature.py:
    # data preprocessing

read_feature.py
    # read feature from files

util.py & util_expand.py:
    # some functions, only a few of them are called
